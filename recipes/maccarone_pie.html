    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        the secret to the recipe is the New Zealand cheddar 
        cheese which is made from grass fed pasteurized cow 
        milk and tastes both buttery and smooth. It may seem 
        curious that mustard and ketchup are in this recipe. 
        But some of the key ingredients spice wise include 
        turmeric and vinegar, which are in mustard. Also, 
        sugar and tomato so ketchup does the trick. There is 
        no doubt that Bajan macaroni pie is a delicious staple 
        in Barbados!

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <ul>
       <li>12 oz macaroni </li> 
       <li>1 tbsp butter </li> 
       <li>1 tbsp olive oil </li> 
       <li>1 egg </li> 
       <li>1 cup milk </li> 
       <li>1 medium white onion, diced finely </li> 
       <li>2 tsp yellow mustard </li> 
       <li>2 tbsp ketchup </li> 
       <li>1 tsp white pepper </li> 
       <li>1 tsp salt </li> 
       <li>16 oz New Zealand Anchor cheddar cheese, grated </li> 
       <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper </li> 
       <li>½ tsp dry ginger </li> 
       <li>½ sweet red pepper, minced (optional) </li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bring a pot of salted 
            water to boil. Cook the macaroni for about 8 minutes
            until just tender (but not done as the macaroni will
            continue to cook in the oven). Drain the macaroni and 
            leave in the strainer.

        <li>
            In a sauté pan, melt the butter and add the oil. Sauté 
            the onion and red pepper (if using) until tender. In a 
            bowl, whisk eggs and milk. Add the mustard, ketchup and 
            seasonings. Add the macaroni, onion mixture and the 
            grated cheese (reserving 4 tablespoons for the topping).
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Pour the macaroni mix into a greased casserole dish.
            Top with a mixture of the panko breadcrumbs and cheese. 
            Bake for about 30-45 minutes depending on the depth of 
            the dish. The pie is done when it is brown and bubbly. 
            This serves 6-8 people. Cheers!
